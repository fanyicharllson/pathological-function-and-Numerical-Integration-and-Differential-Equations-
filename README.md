## Introduction
This project explores complex mathematical concepts and aims to visualize them through Python programming. The primary focus is on:
- **Pathological Functions**: Functions that exhibit unusual or counter-intuitive properties.
- **Numerical Integration**: Techniques to approximate the integral of a function.
- **Differential Equations**: Equations involving derivatives of functions.

## Pathological Functions
Pathological functions are functions that do not adhere to common rules or properties. This section includes:
- Examples of pathological functions.
- Graphical representations to illustrate their unique characteristics.

## Numerical Integration
Numerical integration involves approximating the value of an integral. This section covers:
- Different numerical integration methods.
- Python implementations of these methods.
- Visualizations of the integration process.

## Differential Equations
Differential equations involve functions and their derivatives. This section includes:
- Various types of differential equations.
- Methods to solve these equations numerically.
- Graphical representations of solutions.
